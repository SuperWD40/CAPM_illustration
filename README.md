Issue: Finding the Best Stock Portfolio from Dow Jones 30: An application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and Jensen's Alpha

We will study the historical performance of the Dow Jones 30 and compare it to stocks that compose it. This study will take place in the previous year, on the 30 biggest American stocks in terms of market capitalization.
To conduct this study, we will use web scraping to get financial historical data. We will use Monte Carlo Method to create a stock portfolio. By computing matrices and using vectorization we will compute the metrics of the study. We will principally use these Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy and Statistics.
